> Instantly export designs into production-ready code

> Recently, have you been swamped by AIGC, with a plethora of design content emerging in heaps? Are you still exporting design annotations and slicing images? `huima` can assist you in converting designs into UI-consistent, clean, and tidy interface code (supports responsive units and tailwindcss conversion) with just one click. We've launched corresponding plugins for Figma and real-time design, allowing front-end developers to bid farewell to the tedious task of comparing and restoring designs, and focus on dynamic design development. Why not give it a try? We're currently in the beta testing phase, and you're welcome to join our discussion group by scanning the QR code. The code is open source, and we welcome contributions!
